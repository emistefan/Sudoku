Sudoku generator and solver made with c++ and sfml

The algorithm for solving is straight forward brute force, nothing clever.

Algorithm for generating:
1. Fill valid sudoku grid.
2. Then for each number in grid (random order), remove it, check if sudoku has more than one solution, if true insert number back in.
